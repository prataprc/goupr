- All UPR request frames have vbucket-id (4byte), but couldn't find
  information on how that is used.

- UPR_OPEN response sends uuid ? If so, how to identify the uuid in the
  response frame.

- Will Request DataType be always zero ?

- What is the difference between start-sequence-number and
  high-sequence-number ?
